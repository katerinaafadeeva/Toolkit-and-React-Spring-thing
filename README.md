# Initial idea:
1. Making a page with 2 buttons: Add and Delete, a horizontal sheet below.
When you click on the Add to sheet button, a square element is added to the first position, the width of which is 20% of the screen width, the color of the element is random. When you click on the Delete button, the last element is removed from the sheet.
2. Animation.
When added, all existing elements should smoothly move to the right, the new element should move out from the left side of the screen. When deleting, the last element must go to the right, all other elements must be in place.

# Additional things:

Also used react-spring map method and asynchronous methods in another component and placed it under the main list.

# Running the project:
 Running the project is avaliable with npm start command line
